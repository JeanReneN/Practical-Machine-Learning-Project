- Human Activity Recognition Prediction - Peer Assessment

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project consists of predicting participantsâ€™ activities using exercise data. 
The potential applications of the project include elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure, 
weight-loss program support, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises. Data from accelerometers on the belt, 
forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants are gathered and used for modeling. The question the project tries to answer 
is how to predict the manner in which the participants will perform their exercise.
